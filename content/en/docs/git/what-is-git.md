## 10,000 ft Overview

Git is a source control system. It allows developers, designers, and all other content creators to track the changes that they make to almost any type of file.

Whilst it works best with text-based files (i.e. source code, text files, etc.), it also works with binary formats (i.e. audio, documents, images, 3D models, etc.).

Whilst Git is one of the most common source control systems, there are many others including (but not limited to):

- Concurent Version System (aka cvs)
- Subversion (aka svn)
- Mercurial
- Team Foundation Version Control

## Basic Information

Git was initially created by Linus Torvalds, but has been maintained by Junio Hamano since 2005. It was originally created to make the work of maintaining the Linux kernel easier.

Git is a command line application, but there are many different GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications which hide the complexity of the command line. Some of the most commonly used Git GUI applications are:

- GitHub Desktop
- GitKraken
- SourceTree
- TortoiseGit
