## 10,000 ft Overview

Linux is an Operating System, initially created by Linus Torvalds. It's name is actually GNU Linux, and is completely free and open source. Most embedded systems and low powered devices (included Raspberry Pi and Android phones) run versions of Linux operating systems.

## Beginner Information

Linux is an operating system kernel; this is the core part of an operating system. A kernel communicates directly with the hardware in a computer, and deals with time-slicing and memory management.

There are hundreds (if not thousands) of Linux-based operating systems, each with their own pros and cons. Some popular distributions of Linux are:

- Debian
- Ubuntu (which is based on Debian)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (aka RHEL)
- Fedora (which is based on RHEL)
- Arch
- Manjaro (which is based on Arch)

A bigger list of Linux distributions can be found at [Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions)

## Intermediary Information

Most web servers run variants of Linux distributions, and developers may interact directly with them from time to time in their career.

There are a lot of people who run "desktop Linux", this is where they replace the operating system that their computer shipped with (if it shipped with one) with a desktop distribution of a Linux operating system.
